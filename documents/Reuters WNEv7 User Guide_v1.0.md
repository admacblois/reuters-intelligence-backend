FILE DISTRIBUTION

# Starting and removing file distribution processes

Once a distribution process has been created, press ‘Start’ to begin running the process. Click ‘X’ to remove the process.

# Importing/exporting a distribution process

Individual file distribution processes can be exported as JSON files using the ‘Export’ button. Alternatively, use the ‘Export All’ button to export all file distribution services in one JSON file. If you have any existing WNE file distribution processes in JSON format, you can import these from the ‘Import’ button.

Note: Due to security reasons, your credentials will not be imported as part of the process. Please repopulate these after importing to complete the file distribution setup procedures.
